This circuit description is ON & OFF STATE of LED using SWITCH and interfacing with LCD display.

In this circuit it contains single LED.

LCD(16*2) is an electronic display module that uses liquid crystal to produce a visible text.

16*2 translates a display 16 characters per line in 2 such lines.

Postive terminal of LED is a Anode , Negative terminal of LED is a cathode.

For LED there are two pins which are anode and cathode.

Anode is connected to power , in between one resister is used to avoid the LED breaks ,it also control current flow.

Resistor formule is R = V/I,for LED min 220 ohms is used.

Cathode is connected to ground.

Pins can be connected to either analog nor digital pins.
